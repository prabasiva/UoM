Color Chaos is a model between random-walk model and harmonic model introduced by the Prof. Ping Chen in the paper \cite{pchen} published in Studies in Nonlinear Dynamics and Econometrics quarterly journal. By detail study of the paper \cite{pchen}, the color chaos model generates irregular oscillations with a narrow frequency band. The characteristic frequency is calculated from the Wigner decomposed distribution series. Standard and Poor stock price indexes and NASDAQ price indexes are used to study the color chaos model and detrended by using Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filters.
